                I am a kitchen adventurer who loves photography as much as I
                enjoy food flavors and colors. I appreciate every experience and
                every project. Every detail is an opportunity for me to shine
                and show the best of myself through a photograph.

                I am based in the Netherlands, in the city of The Hague. My work
                involves beautiful food imagery for outdoor campaigns, social
                media, and PR for restaurants and Chefs in Europe. This is
                complemented by many years of experience as Graphic and Visual
                Designer.
