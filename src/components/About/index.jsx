              I am a kitchen adventurer who loves photography as much as I enjoy
              food flavors and colors. I appreciate every experience and every
              project. Every detail is an opportunity for me to shine and show
              the best of myself through a photograph.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am based in the Netherlands, in the city of The Hague. My work
              involves beautiful food imagery for outdoor campaigns, social
              media, and PR for restaurants and Chefs in Europe. This is
              complimented by many years of experience as Graphic and Visual
              Designer.
            </p>

            <p>
              My expertise in Food Photography and Food Styling is backed by Le
              Cordon Bleu Paris and Leiths School of Food and Wine in London.
